Played slightly upbeat, to help maintain rhythm when you slap strings for beat, 
strum as you hit the guitar (little jack johnson trick)

Intro G D Am

Verse 1

G        D 
I've got bills to pay
Am        Am
Taxman on my tail
G         D
Just keep prayin' that
Am         Am
the check's in the mail

G         D
There are times it seems
Am                C 
when everything's lost
Am               C
and I'm moaning, I'm tossed
D(rollup)
and I see..

Chorus

                     Am
between the river and the ravens I'm fed
                  C
between oblivion and the blazes I'm led
      G                        D
So father give me faith, providence and grace
                 Am
Between the river and ravens I'm fed
               C                   D
Sweet deliver, oh you lift up my head
                     G
and lead me in your way

Verse 2

G          D
I've grown sick and tired
Am           Am
of trying to stand still
G               D
I've learned to let the wind
Am            Am
pull me where it will

G        D
Throw myself into
Am          C
the will of the wait
Am          C
I can never be great
D(rollup)
'til we're free

Chorus

                     Am
between the river and the ravens I'm fed
                  C
between oblivion and the blazes I'm led
      G                        D
So father give me faith, providence and grace
                 Am
Between the river and ravens I'm fed
               C                   D
Sweet deliver, oh you lift up my head
                     G
and lead me in your way

Bridge (Same as chorus)


Verse 3

G            D                               -|
Although I'm walking through                  |
Am            Am                              |
the valley of the shadow of death             |
G       D                                     |
evils all around                              |
Am                 Am                         |
It's coming from the right and the left       |
                                              |palm muted section
G          D                                  |
Trust that I will see                         |
Am        C                                   |
the glory above                               |
Am        C                                   |
Oh, your banner of love                       |
D(rollup)                                     |
flies over me                                -|

Chorus/Outro

                     Am
between the river and the ravens I'm fed
                  C
between oblivion and the blazes I'm led
      G                        D
So father give me faith, providence and grace
                 Am
Between the river and ravens I'm fed
               C                   D
Sweet deliver, oh you lift up my head
                     G
and lead me in your way
               C                   D
Sweet deliver, oh you lift up my head
                     G
and lead me in your way
