# Dustin Kensrue - Wrecking Ball

```
Capo 2

VERSE 1

   Am                     C     
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain

   G                  Dm
We jumped never asking why

   Am               C  
We kissed, I fell under your spell

  G                  Dm
A love no one could deny



PRECHORUS

F                  Am    
Don't you ever say I just walked away

C                 F
I will always want you

F                   Am    
I can't live a lie, running for my life

C                 F
I will always want you



CHORUS
   
                 C            G
I came in like a wrecking ball, 

               Am           F
I never hit so hard in love

                    C             G
All I wanted was to break your walls

                    Am      F
All you ever did was wreck me

       Am             F      F
Yeah, you, you wreck me



VERSE 2

  Am              C   
I put you high up in the sky

    G                  Dm
And now, you're not coming down

   Am                 C   
It slowly turned, you let me burn

    G                     Dm
And now, we're ashes on the ground



PRECHORUS

F                  Am    
Don't you ever say I just walked away

C                 F
I will always want you

F                   Am    
I can't live a lie, running for my life

C                 F       F
I will always want you



CHORUS
   
                 C            G
I came in like a wrecking ball, 

               Am           F
I never hit so hard in love

                    C             G
All I wanted was to break your walls

                    Am      F
All you ever did was wreck me

       Am             F      F
Yeah, you, you wreck me



BRDIGE

  F                      Am
I never meant to start a war

                            C
I just wanted you to let me in

                     Em
And instead of using force

                            F
I guess I should've let you win

                         Am
I never meant to start a war

                            C
I just wanted you to let me in

                            Em
I guess I should've let you win



PRECHORUS

F                  Am    
Don't you ever say I just walked away

C                 F
I will always want you



CHORUS/ENDING
   
                 C            G
I came in like a wrecking ball, 

               Am           F
I never hit so hard in love

                    C             G
All I wanted was to break your walls

All you ever did was wreck me

                 C            G
I came in like a wrecking ball

                       Am             F
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung

                      C            G
Left me crashing in a blazing fall

                    Am      F
All you ever did was wreck me

       Am             F
Yeah, you, you wreck me

       Am             F
Yeah, you, you wreck me
