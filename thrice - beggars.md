Intro: Em, C

         Em                          C
All you great men of power, you who boast of your feats 
      Em                    C
Politicians and entrepreneurs
        Em                           C
Can you safeguard your breath in the night while you sleep
          Em                        C
Keep your heart beating steady and sure
        D                         Am6
As you lie in your bed, does the thought haunt your head
            Em              A7
That you’re really, rather small
            C                         B11                Em
If there’s one thing I know in this life: we are beggars all.

       (Em)                       C
All you champions of science and rulers of men,
        Em                        C
Can you summon the sun from its sleep
         Em                         C
Does the earth seek your counsel on how fast to spin
         Em                          C
Can you shut up the gates of the deep
          D                             Am6
Don’t you know that all things hang, as if by a string,
         Em                   A7
O’er the darkness,  poised to fall?
           C                          B11                Em
If there’s one thing I know in this life: we are beggars all.

        Em                          C
All you big shots that swagger and stride with conceit,
         Em                               C
Did you devise how your frame would be formed
             Em                     C
If you’d be raised in a palace, or live out in the streets,
         Em                                   C
Did you choose the place or the hour you’d be born
         D                         Am6
Tell me what can you claim? Not a thing,  not your name
         Em         A7             C    
Tell me if you can recall just one thing,
                           B11
That’s not a gift in this life

        Am                 
Can you hear what’s been said
       B11                        Em           A7
Can you see now that everything’s grace after all
            C                       B11                       Em
If there’s one thing I know in this life: we are beggars all.
