Am F x2


[Verse]

       Am                         F                   Am
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees 'cause I
       F           Am          F       Am      F
I want honey on my table.
       Am                         F                   Am
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees 'cause I
       F            Am          F       Am      F
I want honey on my table.


[Prechorus]

      G            F
But I never get it right.
      G            F
No, I never get it right.


[Chorus]

        Am                        F
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees;
        Am                     F   
I can't understand why they're stingin' me.
         F
But I'll do what I want,
     F
I'll do what I please,
     E
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need.
     Am                        F
I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest.
        Am          F
Do you understand I deserve the best?
         F
'Til you do what I want,
     F
I'll do what I please,
     E
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need.

Am F x2


[Verse]

         Am                       F                Am
I try to stick this pin through a butterfly 'cause I
        F             Am       F       Am      F
I like all the pretty colors.
        Am               F               Am
It just fell apart, so I flung it in the fire
   F                 Am        F       Am      F
to burn with all the others


[Prechorus]

         G            F
'cause I never get it right.
      G            F
No, I never get it right.


[Chorus]

        Am                        F
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees;
        Am                     F   
I can't understand why they're stingin' me.
         F
But I'll do what I want,
     F
I'll do what I please,
     E
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need.
     Am                        F
I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest.
        Am          F
Do you understand I deserve the best?
         F
'Til you do what I want,
     F
I'll do what I please,
     E
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need.


[Bridge] 
(Palm mute)

G                      F
This time, I'll get it right
G                      F
This time, I'll get it right
              G                     F
It's gonna be this time I'll get it right.
               G                  F
God, let it be this time I get it right.


[Outro Chorus]

       Dm                          F
So I'm cuttin' that branch off the cherry tree
         Am             G            F
singin' this will be my victory then I
         G
see them comin' after me
            Dm           F
and they're followin me across the sea
                Am                        G          F
and now they're stingin my friends and my family and I
           G
don't know why this is happening
         F
But I'll do what I want
     F
I'll do what I please
     E
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
       Am                         F                    Am
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees 'cause I
       F           Am         F       End on Am
I want honey on my table.
