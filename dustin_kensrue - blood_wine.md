E
I've been with Sally
E
I've been with Sue
E                             E/D1
I've been with Cindy and her sister too
A
Now I'm tryin' to settle down
A                                        E    E/D2
Start a family with that cute little Kim
B                                   A
But now that I've tasted blood,
                                       E    E7
Now this wine seems too thin

E
I've got a needle, don't be alarmed
E                                  E/D1 
It shoots streams of lovely things into my arm
A                                                  E   E/D2
Well I'd sell my own mother for that sweet heroin
B                                    A
Oh, now that I've tasted blood
                                       E   E7
Now this wine seems too thin

E
Sometimes the white coats; They hide black hearts
E                                     E/D1
We've learned to sugar coat the same black arts
A                                                        E  E/D2
Well, I've turned lead into gold. I'll cure original sin. 
B                                   A
Oh, now that i've tasted blood
                                       E   E7
Now this wine seems too thin

E
Oh, well I walked in the bank
E
And I pulled out my gun
E                                E/D1
You should've seen those people scream and run.
A
I used to make an honest buck; 
A                                   E    E/D2
How can i go back to that again?
B                                   A
Oh, now that i've tasted blood
E
Now this wine seems too thin
B                                   A
Oh, now that i've tasted blood
E
Now this wine seems too thin
B                                   A
Oh, now that i've tasted blood
                             E   B   A   E (end strumming E once)
Now this wine seems too thin
