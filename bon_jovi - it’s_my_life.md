# Bon Jovi - Itâ€™s My Life

```
Capo 2

[Verse]

Am                        F           C G
This ain't a song for the brokenhearted
Am                       F              C G
No silent prayer for the faith departed
    Am                      F     
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
             C                    G
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud


[Chorus]

        Am
It's my life
     F            C
It's now or never 
              G            Am
I ain't gonna live forever
             F              C     G
I just wanna live while I'm alive

       Am                        F            C
Its my life, My heart is like an open highway
                      G            Am         
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
             F               C
I just wanna live while I'm alive
       G    Em Am
'Cause it's my life

(Repeat these chords in the same places until the end of the song)


[Verse]

Am                        F                 C G
This is for the ones who stood their ground
Am                       F               C G
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
    Am                      F     
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
             C                    G
Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks


[Chorus]

        Am
It's my life
     F            C
It's now or never 
              G            Am
I ain't gonna live forever
             F              C     G
I just wanna live while I'm alive

       Am                        F            C
Its my life, My heart is like an open highway
                      G            Am         
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
             F               C
I just wanna live while I'm alive
       G    Em Am
'Cause it's my life


[Bridge]

Am
You better stand tall

When they're calling you out

Don't bend, don't break

Baby, don't back down


[Chorus]

        Am
It's my life
     F            C
It's now or never 
              G            Am
I ain't gonna live forever
             F              C     G
I just wanna live while I'm alive

       Am                        F            C
Its my life, My heart is like an open highway
                      G            Am         
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
             F               C
I just wanna live while I'm alive
       G    Em Am
'Cause it's my life

        Am
It's my life
     F            C
It's now or never 
              G            Am
I ain't gonna live forever
             F              C     G
I just wanna live while I'm alive

       Am                        F            C
Its my life, My heart is like an open highway
                      G            Am         
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
             F               C
I just wanna live while I'm alive
       G    Em Am
'Cause it's my life
