[Intro]     

Am


[Verse 1]

  Am                                F
 You and me, we're always with each other
   Am                                G
 Before we knew the other was ever there
 Am                       F
 You and me, we belong together
       G        F    Em        Am
 Just like a breath needs the air


[Verse 2]

 Am                                      F
 I told you if you called, I would come runnin'
   Am                                       G
 Across the highs, the lows and the in between
  Am                                    F
 You and me we've got two minds that think as one
           G           F      Em   Am
 And our hearts march to the same beat


[Chorus]

          C
 They say everything, it happens for a reason
             Am
 You can be flawed enough but perfect for a person
                   G
 Someone who will be there for you when you fall apart
                 F
 Guiding your direction when you're riding though the dark
                   Am
 Oh that's you and me


[Verse 3]

  Am                                 F
 You and me we're searching for the same light
 Am                               G
 Desperate for a cure to this desease
            Am                  F
 Well some days are better than others
         G                F       Em        Am
 But I fear no thing as long as you're with me


[Chorus]

          C
 They say everything, it happens for a reason
             Am
 You can be flawed enough but perfect for a person
                   G
 Someone who will be there for you when you fall apart
                 F
 Guiding your direction when you're riding though the dark
              C
 And they say everything, it happens for a reason
             Am
 You can be flawed enough but perfect for a person
                   G
 Someone who will be there for you when you fall apart
                 F
 Guiding your direction when you're riding though the dark
                    C
 Oh that's you and me
                   Am
 Oh that's you and me
                    G
 Oh that's you and me
                 F
 That's you and me
                 C
 That's you and me
