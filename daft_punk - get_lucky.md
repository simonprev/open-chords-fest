(E)                                        Bm           D
Like the legend of the phoenix
                                F#            E
Our ends were beginnings
                                                 Bm              D
What keeps the planet spinning   Aah Ah

The force from the beginning


Chorus :

Bm                  D
We've come too far
              F#m                 E
To give up who we are
    Bm                 D
So let's raise the bar
                F#m               E
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun

I'm up all night to get some

She's up all night for good fun
E
I'm up all night to get lucky
Bm
We're up all night 'til the sun
D
We're up all night to get some
F#m
We're up all night for good fun
E
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
D
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
E
We're up all night to get lucky 


Bridge : Bm D F#m E


(E)                         Bm       D
The present has no rhythm
                                      F#m    E
Your gift keeps on giving
                                    Bm        D
What is this I'm feeling?
                                                F#m                       E
If you want to leave, I'm with it   Aah ah


Chorus


Bm                  D
We've come too far
              F#m                 E
To give up who we are
    Bm                 D
So let's raise the bar
                F#m               E
And our cups to the stars
Bm
She's up all night 'til the sun
D
I'm up all night to get some
F#m
She's up all night for good fun
E
I'm up all night to get lucky
Bm
We're up all night 'til the sun
D
We're up all night to get some
F#m
We're up all night for good fun
E
We're up all night to get lucky
