G           Cadd9
What day is it
Dsus4/F#    G/B
And in what month
     Em7         Dsus4     Cadd9
This clock never seemed so alive
G            Cadd9
I can't keep up
    Dsus4/F#     G/B
And I can't back down
          Em7
I've been losing
Dsus4   Cadd9
So much time


            G       A7sus4
Cause' it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
     Em7        G
With nothing to do
Em7        Dsus
Nothing to lose
            G       A7sus4
Cause' it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
    Em7          G
And I don't know why
  Em7           Dsus        Cadd9
I can't keep my eyes off of you


G          Cadd9
What other things
      Dsus4/F#  G/B
That  I  wanna  say
Em7         Dsus4      Cadd9
Just aren't coming out right
    G           Cadd9
I'm tripping on words
       Dsus4/F#    G/B
You've got my head spinning
  Em7              Dsus4      Cadd9
I don't know where to go from here


            G       A7sus4
Cause' it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
     Em7        G
With nothing to do
    Em7        Dsus
And nothing to prove
         G       A7sus4
And it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
    Em7          G
And I don't know why
  Em7           Dsus        G
I can't keep my eyes off of you


Bm        C
Something about you now
G       D            Em7
I can't quite figure out
Am                     D
Everything she does is beautiful
Bm                     Cm
Everything she does is right


            G       A7sus4
Cause' it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
     Em7        G
With nothing to do
    Em7        Dsus
And nothing to lose
         G       A7sus4
And it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
    Em7          G
And I don't know why
  Em7           Dsus
I can't keep my eyes off of


G       A7sus4
You and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
     Em7        G
With nothing to do
    Em7        Dsus
And nothing to prove
         G       A7sus4
And it's you and me
    Cadd9
And all of the people
    Em7          G
And I don't know why
  Em7           Dsus        G
I can't keep my eyes off of you
