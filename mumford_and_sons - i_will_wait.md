    Verse

C
I came home
         F
Like a stone
             C              G2
And I fell heavy into your arms

          C
These days of dust
           F
Which we've known
          C                  G2
Will blow away with this new sun

    Pre-Chorus

     Am    Em2     C
And I'll kneel down 
  F   C   G
Wait for now
    Am     Em2     C
And I'll kneel down
    F    C   G
Know my ground

    Chorus

 C                             Em   G      
I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                 Em   G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!



C x4



C
So break my step
      F
And relent
      C                    G2
You forgave and I won't forget
                C
Know what we've seen
             F
And him with less
            C                 G2  
Now in some way, shake the excess



 C                                Em     G 
Cause I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                Em    G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                Em    G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                Em    G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!


 C
Now I'll be bold
            F
As well as strong
        C                           G2         G
Use my head alongside my heart
           C
So take my flesh
           F
And fix my eyes
              C                           G2           G           
That tethered mind free from the lies


   Am    Em2     C
And I'll kneel down 
  F   C   G
Wait for now
    Am     Em2     C
And I'll kneel down
    F    C   G
Know my ground



 C     Em2  Am      F   C   G     x2
 


 C    Em2  Am
Raise my hands
 F          C       G
Paint my spirit gold
     C    Em2  Am
And bow my head
 F          C      G   
Keep my heart slow        
        

 C                                Em     G 
Cause I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                Em    G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                Em    G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 C                                Em    G  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!

End with C
