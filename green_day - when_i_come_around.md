# Green Day - When I Come Around

```
Verse: G, D, Em, C
Chorus:  Am, C

G    D                Em     C  
   I heard you crying loud
G          D         Em     C  
  all the way across town
             G                  D
You've been searching for that someone
         Em              C
and it's me out on the prowl
    G            D         Em           C
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

G      D                Em    C
  Well Don't get lonely now
G     D                Em     C
  And Dry your whining eyes
         G               D
I'm just roaming for the moment
         Em                     C
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get 
G               D                   Em        C
so uptight you been thinking about ditching me


Am                         C
    No time to search the world around.
Am                                C
    Cause you know where I'll be found
    
    When I come around

G, D, Em, C 
G, D, Em, C 
 
G    D             Em     C  
  I heard it all before
G     D                   Em     C  
  So don't knock down my door
       G           D         Em            C  
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
    G               D              Em          C  
to try and slag me down because I know you're right
G    D              Em    C 
  So go do what you like
G       D             Em   C 
  Make sure you do it wise
         G                  D             
You may find out that your selfdoubt 
        Em             C
means nothing was ever there
     G                D  
You can't go forcing something 
         Em       C
if it's just not right



Am                         C
    No time to search the world around.
Am                                C
    Cause you know where I'll be found
    
    When I come around

G, D, Em, C 
G, D, Em, C 

SOLO (i leave the solo to someone else..)


Am                         C
    No time to search the world around.
Am                                C
    Cause you know where I'll be found
    
    When I come around

G, D, Em, C
