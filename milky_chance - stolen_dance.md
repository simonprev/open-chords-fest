VERSE:
G#m        F#      E 
I want you by my side
B                    D#  
So that I never feel alone again
G#m            F#      E 
They've always been so kind
B                           D#  
But now they've brought you away from here
G#m          F#             E 
I hope they didn't get your mind
B                        D#  
Your heart is too strong anyway
G#m        F#             E 
We need to fetch back the time
B                     D#  
They have stolen from us


CHORUS:
E 
And I want you
B
We can bring it on the floor
             D#               G#m
You've never danced like this before
             F#
But we don't talk about it
E                  B
Dancin on doin the boogie all night long
D#           G#m
Stoned in paradise
F#
Shouldn't talk about it

E 
And I want you
B
We can bring it on the floor
             D#               G#m
You've never danced like this before
             F#
But we don't talk about it
E                  B
Dancin on doin the boogie all night long
D#           G#m
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

G#m        F#      E 
Coldest winter for me
B                 D#  
No sun is shining anymore
G#m        F#      E  
The only thing I feel is pain
B                 D#  
Caused by absence of you
G#m        F#      E  
Suspence is controlling my mind 
B                 D# 
I cannot find the way out of here
G#m        F#      E  
I want you by my side
