```
Tuning: Half step down or capo 4 for non-super-high-vocals

E              C#m                 A                 B          D         E 
Breathe in for luck Breathe in so deep This air is blessed you share with me 
              C#m               A                      B        D 
This night is wild so calm and dull These hearts they race from self control
E              C#m                  A              B                      
Your legs are smooth as they graze mine Were doing fine Were doing nothing at

        E                                             G#m7    
Chorus: all My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me so wont you 
Aadd2            G#m7  Aadd2   G#m7  E                            Gm#7
kill me so I die happy               My heart is yours to fill or burst to 
         Aadd2            G#m7    Aadd2    G#m7     
break or bury or wear as jewelry whichever you prefer

E                                 C#m             A                 B      
The words are hushed lets not get busted just lay entwined here undiscovered
D       E                                 C#m                   A            
        Safe in here from all the stupid questions "Hey did you get some" man
            B     D      E               C#m                       A 
that is so dumb          Stay quiet Stay near Stay close They cant hear so
       B           D  
we can get some 


Chorus x1

C#m                    A               E             B  
Hands Down this is the best day I  can ever remember always remember 
C#m                     A                          E             
the sound of the stereo the dim of the soft lights the scent of your hair
         B                               C#m                       A 
that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized 
                     E                     B             C#m   
its so late and this walk that we shared   together  The streets were wet and
    A                    E               B                  C#m  
the gate was locked so I jumped it and I let you in and you stood at your
               A                         E                  B     
door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it and I 
C#m                             A                 E        B 
knew that you meant it that you meant it that you meant it that you meant it
      C#m           A                 E
And I knew that you meant it that you meant it
