Capo 1

C  F  Am  F  (x2)

           C                         F
I'm always running scared through an endless night.
                   Am                  F
The moon is just a memory, her and her fabled light.
           C                         F
But when I close my eyes sometimes I dare to dream,
                    Am                     F
But I'm sure nobody cares for me, no one's there with me 
       C        F       Am      F
In the darkness, in the darkness 


               C                      F
Sometimes I'll howl a tune to hear it echo back,
                    Am                   F
Then clutch it like some ancient rune to ward off the black.
             C                F
But when the wolves join in I hold my breath and shake,
                       Am                     F
'Cause I'm sure nobody cares for me, no one's there with me 
       C        F       Am      F
In the darkness, in the darkness  (x2)


            G 
But now I'm standing here beneath that great abyss,
                     F
Staring up I feel my legs give way, I feel a ghostly kiss.
  G
I hear the hidden stars sing out the one true myth,
                       F
Their singing that you care for me, and you're there with me 
       C
in the darkness.
        F                            Am
But I'm always running scared in the darkness
         F                             C
Could it be you're really there in the darkness?
               F          
It's more than I could ever dare to dream,
               Am
That you would care for me,
            F
That you're there with me 
       C        F       Am      F
in the darkness, in the darkness 
       C        F
in the darkness
       Am
Do you care for me?
        F            F
Are you there in the darkness?
