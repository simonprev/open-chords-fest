# Green Day - Jesus of Suburbia

```
Capo on 1st

C
I'm the son of rage and love
Am
The Jesus of suburbia				
F
From the Bible of none of the above
G
On a steady diet of 

C
Soda pop and Ritalin
Am
No one ever died for my 
F
Sins in hell, as far as I can tell				
G
At least the ones I've gotten away with

F                              G
And there's nothing wrong with me
F                           G
This is how I'm supposed to be	
F                 G		
In a land of make believe

That don't believe in me

| C - G | F | (x2)

C
Get my television fix
Am 
Sitting on my crucifix
F				
The living room or my private womb
G
While the moms and brads are away

C
To fall in love and fall in debt
Am
To alcohol and cigarettes 			
F
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
G
And doing someone else's cocaine

F                              G
And there's nothing wrong with me
F                           G
This is how I'm supposed to be	
F                 G		
In a land of make believe

That don't believe in me

| C | E  | Am – G | F | G |

C
At the center of the earth
C/B
In the parking lot				
Am               G
Of the 7-11 were I was taught
F                    G
The motto was just a lie

C
It says home is were your heart is
C/B
But what a shame
Am				G
Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
F                    G
We're beating out of time

Am      G
City of the dead
C             F
At the end of another lost highway
Am      G          F
Sign misleading to nowhere			
Am      G
City of the damned
C                  F
Lost children with dirty faces today
Am     G               F
No one really seems to care

C
I read the graffiti
C/B
In the bathroom stall				
Am                            G
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
F                   G
And so it seemed to confess

C
It didn't say much
C/B
But it only confirmed that			
Am                             G
The center of the earth is the end of the world
F                       G
And I could really care less

Am      G
City of the dead
C             F
At the end of another lost highway
Am      G          F
Sign misleading to nowhere			
Am      G
City of the damned
C                  F
Lost children with dirty faces today
Am     G               F
No one really seems to care
