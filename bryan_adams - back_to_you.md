[Verse 1] 

          C                Am
 I've been down - I've been beat
             F                         G
 I've been so tired - that I could not speak
             C                    Am
 I've been so lost that I could not see
          F                      G
 I wanted things that were out of reach
      C                   Am
 Then I found you and you helped me through
        F                 G
 And you showed me what to do
        F                      E
 That's why I'm coming back to you...

          
[Chorus]  
  
        Am           F               G
Like a star guides a ship across the ocean
                Am           F            G
That's how your love take me home back to you
          Em              Am
And if I wish upon that star,
              Em                Am
That someday I'll be where you are
   F                       G
I know that day is coming soon, 
                         C 
Yeah, I'm coming back to you

[Verse 2]

          C                Am
 You've been alone, you didn't show it
             F                     G
 You've been in pain when I didnâ€™t know it
             C              Am
 You let me do what I needed to,
          F                   G
 You were there when I needed you
             C                    Am
 Mighta let you down, mighta messed you round
             F                   G
 But you never changed your point of view
        F                      E
 That's why I'm coming back to you


[Chorus]  
  
        Am           F               G
Like a star guides a ship across the ocean
                Am           F            G
That's how your love take me home back to you
          Em              Am
And if I wish upon that star,
              Em                Am
That someday I'll be where you are
   F                       G
I know that day is coming soon, 
                         C 
Yeah, I'm coming back to you

    That's why I'm coming back to you

                    Am     F    G
