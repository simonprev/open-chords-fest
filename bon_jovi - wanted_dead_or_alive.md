# Bon Jovi - Wanted Dead Or Alive

```
D                   C                 G   
It's all the same , only the names will change
C         G       F                  D  
And ev'ry day , it seems we're wasting away
D               C                      G
Another place , where the faces are so cold
C             G            F           D
I'd drive all night , just to get back home


CHORUS:
C        G        F               D                    
I'm a cowboy , on a steel horse I ride
C         G  F       D 
I'm wanted , dead or alive
C     G  F       D
Wanted , dead or alive


D                   C                   G 
Sometimes I sleep , sometimes is not for days
C             G           F                  D
and people I meet , always go their separate ways
D                            C                     G
Sometimes you tell the day , by the bottle that you drink
C                    G           F             D
And times when you´r alone , and all you do is think


CHORUS:
C        G        F               D                    
I'm a cowboy , on a steel horse I ride
C         G  F       D 
I'm wanted , dead or alive
C     G  F       D
Wanted , dead or alive

SOLO:

C                    G        F              D 
Ooooh and I'm a cowboy , on a street horse I ride
C                     F       D  
I'm wanted (wanted) , dead or alive


D                          C                        G  
And I walk these streets , a loaded six string on my back
C             G          F                   D
I play for keeps , 'cause I might not make it back
D                    C                 G
I been ev'ry where , still I'm standig tall
C                  G           F              D  
I've seen a milion faces , and I've rock them all

       
C                 G        F             D
'Cause I'm a cowboy , on a steel horse I ride
C         G           F       D     
I'm wanted (wanted) , dead or alive
C               G             F           D
Well I'm a cowboy , I got the night on my side
C          G          F       D  
I'm Wanted (wanted) , dead or alive
C       G       C       G
Dead or Alive , Dead or alive
C       G        F         D

C       G       C       G
Dead or alive , dead or alive
C       G 
Dead or alive , Dead or alive ...........
