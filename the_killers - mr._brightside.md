# The Killers - Mr. Brightside

```
Capo 1

C   C/B   F ( x 2 )


C	         C/B
Coming out of my cage  
			  F
And I've been doing just fine
		   
Gotta gotta be down
		   C
Because I want it all 

C		      C/B
It started out with a kiss
			 F 
How did it end up like this?
		
It was only a kiss
		C
It was only a kiss

		C/B
Now I'm falling asleep
                     F
And she's calling a cab
                      
While he's having a smoke
 	               C
And she's taking the drag 
                  C/B
Now they're going to bed
                  F
And my stomach is sick
                   
And it's all in my head
                        Am
But she's touching his chest now 
                   G
He takes off her dress now
       F
Let me go
 Am            
And I just can't look
      G
It's killing me
       F
And taking control 

C
Jealousy
F	         Am
Turning saints into the sea
G		      C
Turning (swimming) through sick lullaby
F	        Am
Joking on your alibi
G	           C
But it's just the price I pay
F	   Am
Destiny is calling me
G	    C	          F
Open up my eager eyes
Am        G	   
I'm Mr. Brightside 

C   F  Am   G  ( x 4 )

( Repeat from start )

I never
   C  F  Am  G ( repeat )
